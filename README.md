# 🧠 Cognize

> _Do you remember why you picked up your phone?_  
> _Make yourself aware of your life._  
> _Decide how to spend your life._

**Cognize** is a mindfulness-focused iOS app designed to help users become more intentional with their phone usage. Rather than just blocking apps or reducing screen time, Cognize empowers users to reflect on their goals, log their intentions, and develop a conscious relationship with technology.

---

## Project Status

**Cognize is currently in early development.**  
Features are actively being prototyped, and UX concepts are still evolving.

---

## Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Unlike traditional screen time or productivity apps, Cognize:

- Helps users **realize their intention** before using their phone
- Builds **consciousness**, not just control
- Introduces a unique **category-based restriction system**
- Encourages **reflection**, not guilt

---

## Core Concept

### Category-Based Logic
All apps are grouped into **user-defined categories**, each with its own restriction behavior:
- **Shield** – Completely blocks access unless user manually unlocks with intention
- **Interval** – Allows short usages (e.g., 5 min within any 15 min window)
- **Allow** – Open access, optionally with soft limits

---

## Built With

- Swift + SwiftUI
- Screen Time API (FamilyControls, DeviceActivity, ManagedSettings)
- SwiftData storage for privacy-first logs
